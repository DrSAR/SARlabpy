SARlabpy's documentation!
==========================

The code is hosted in the `private repository by github <https://github.com/DrSAR/SARlabpy.git>`_.
If you are stuck with branches and commits, try this quickstart: (assuming you have no uncommitted local changes or local commits not pushed to the central repo that you care about):

.. code-block:: bash

   rm -rf SARlabpy # remove any traces of the local copy of the repository
   git clone git@pfeifer.phas.ubc.ca:SARlabpy # make a new fresh clone
   cd SARlabpy # you will now be on the master branch
   git checkout --track origin/thatbranchthatIusedbefore # if you are continuing on an old existing branch
   git checkout -b newfeaturebranch # if you are starting on something new

.. include:: ../README.rst
